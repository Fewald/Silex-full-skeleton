In this repo You can find

All console commands should be done o=in root directory.

At First You need initialize env with which You will work.
In console run command:

`php init.php run:env dev`

This will run env **dev**, you can run other one, for example **prod** or create you own env like **stage** and run it. 


In `./console/commands` is created `FirstCommand.php` as example.
